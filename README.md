This is a Playwright JavaScript project. I wanted to showcase my versatility and language proficiency.
The only dependency for this project is Playwright, as the package.json states.

To run the project, you obviously need Node.js.
Then you can clone the repo and navigate to that directory and open the command prompt.
Playwright can be run in various ways.
I used this command: npx playwright test --project=chromium --headed.
You can even use: npx playwright test --project=chromium --headed --debug (this way you will see the flow of code).

Thank you so much for the opportunity.
I appreciate your time and efforts.

Kind regards,
M
